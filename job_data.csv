(2) recently separated veterans; (3)        active duty wartime or campaign badge veterans; and (4) armed forces service medal veterans.        these classifications are defined as follows:	a “disabled veteran” is one of the following:	a veteran of the u.s. military, ground, naval or air service who is entitled            to compensation (or who but for the receipt of military retired pay would            be entitled to compensation) under laws administered by the secretary of            veterans affairs; or	a person who was discharged or released from active duty because of a service-connected disability.	a “recently separated veteran”        means any veteran during the three-year period        beginning on the date of such veteran’s discharge or release from active duty in        the u.s. military, ground, naval, or air service.	an “active duty wartime or campaign badge veteran” means a veteran who served        on active duty in the u.s. military, ground, naval or air service during a war, or in        a campaign or expedition for which a campaign badge has been authorized under        the laws administered by the department of defense.	an “armed forces service medal veteran” means a veteran who, while serving on        active duty in the u.s. military, ground, naval or air service, participated in a        united states military operation for which an armed forces service medal was        awarded pursuant to executive order 12985.	protected veterans may have additional rights under userra – the uniformed services        employment and reemployment rights act. in particular, if you were absent from employment        in order to perform service in the uniformed service, you may be entitled to be reemployed by        your employer in the position you would have obtained with reasonable certainty if not for the        absence due to service. for more information, call the u.s. department of labor’s veterans        employment and training service (vets), toll-free, at 1-866-4-usa-dol.	if you believe you belong to any of the categories of protected veterans listed        above, please indicate by checking the appropriate box below. as a government contractor        subject to vevraa, we request this information in order to measure the effectiveness of the        outreach and positive recruitment efforts we undertake pursuant to vevraa.	submission of this information is voluntary and refusal to provide will not subject you to any adverse treatment.        the information provided will be used only in ways that are not inconsistent with the vietnam era veterans' readjustment        assistance act of 1974, as amended.	because luminex is a federal contractor, we are obligated to request that all candidates fill out and submit the attached form for our records. the data collected in this form will not be considered in the hiring process or thereafter. any information that you do provide will be recorded and maintained in a confidential file. if you have any questions or you would like to view the affirmative action plan, please contact cissy lara at clara@luminexorp.com.	i identify as one or more of the classifications of protected veteran listed above	i am not a protected veteran	i prefer not to answer	by pressing continue, you will see questions from the employer that are part of this application.	continue	cancel","https://www.indeed.com/viewjob?jk=a91115c37fd1eb7c&q=machine+learning+engineer&l=Seattle,+WA&from=web&advn=151539566173780&adid=325629452&sjdu=6Fy_GZmc5y0UzsNycBkIVKg_t4ayDHJM1fVtjsPDl5MiSpDZLavbfj9ZLJNKUvVOxg0ZonNQrIrDfZQkiN616o0JJGfUOpN0G5F6-GmQO_xo-FZo8uNbGdxHA0MM1Ejy&acatk=1e96lr6bvf1fb800&pub=4a1b367933fd867b19b072952f68dceb&vjs=3",17,,1,0,1,22,2,0,0,0,0,0
