(2) recently separated veterans; (3)        active duty wartime or campaign badge veterans; and (4) armed forces service medal veterans.        these classifications are defined as follows:	a “disabled veteran” is one of the following:	a veteran of the u.s. military, ground, naval or air service who is entitled            to compensation (or who but for the receipt of military retired pay would            be entitled to compensation) under laws administered by the secretary of            veterans affairs;
